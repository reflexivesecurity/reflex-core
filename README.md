- [reflex-engine](https://www.github.com/cloudmitigator/reflex-engine), Terraform modules for deploying required Reflex rule infrastructure.

## Installation

`pip install reflex-core`

## Usage
To utilize `reflex-core`, simply import the rule class you want to utilize and implement the required methods.  

```
from reflex_core import AWSRule

class MyRule(AWSRule):
    def extract_event_data(event):
        # Logic for extracting required event info

    def resource_compliant():
        # Logic for determining if the resource configuration is compliant

    # etc
```
